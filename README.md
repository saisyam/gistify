# gistify
Github only supports gists to embed inside a webpage. Using **gistify** you can embed any source file inside your webpages.

# Usage

To embed any source file into your webpage all you have to do is, pass the Github URL of the file to gistify app deployed at [https://gistify.saisyam.com](https://gistify.saisyam.com). 

For example, to display, [https://github.com/saisyam/gistify/blob/master/main.py](https://github.com/saisyam/gistify/blob/master/main.py) this file, you have to call 

[https://gistify.saisyam.com/https://github.com/saisyam/gistify/blob/master/main.py](https://gistify.saisyam.com/https://github.com/saisyam/gistify/blob/master/main.py).

# Display specific lines
You can even display specific lines from the file. All you have to do is provide the line numbers as comma separated and range with hyphen. In the above example, to display lines 1, 2 and from 8 to 15, you have to pass:

[https://gistify.saisyam.com/https://github.com/saisyam/gistify/blob/master/main.py/l/1,2,8-15](https://gistify.saisyam.com/https://github.com/saisyam/gistify/blob/master/main.py/l/1,2,8-15)
